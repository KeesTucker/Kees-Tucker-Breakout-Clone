# Programming-Test-Breakout
 Programming test for Phat Loot Studios
 
 Features:
 - Full Networking, you could connect as many clients as you like. I thought I would leave it like this as capping it to 2 players is very easy, I tried it with 3 people and it was a lot of fun.
 - Armoured bricks (require 2 hits to destroy)
 - Difficulty curve (as you hit more blocks and work your way up through the bricks the speed of the ball increases)
 - Simulated friction on paddle (if you move the paddle quickly you can impart some of the velocity onto the ball, allowing for trick shots and more skill)
 - Slight randomisation applied to rebounds to avoid a perfect rebound pattern (ie the ball moving perfectly horizontally out of your reach)
 - Game Over and Win conditions, with restart

Controls:
- Space to release the ball
- Move mouse to move the paddle
